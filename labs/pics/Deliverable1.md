## Difficulties Encountered 

**Minecraft download issue:**
There are many version of minecraft available like Windows 10 Edition, Pocket edition,Java version and even there is an online browser based Minecraft. So, after researching found that most tutorials availabe are of Java version.

I also had issue from where to download Minecraft. I head over to the official site, choose Minecraft Java and linux edition and it was a paid one. Then I found, there is also a moded version as TLauncher. So, I downloaded that.

**Minecraft Server Choose:**

There are some options online to make Minecraft server. Like for example, we can choose a hosting provider, we can also use AWS for minecraft server, or there are online options where have to make an account on some site and make server there. All of these are pre-made options.So, after researching, I found that I can myself download and configure the server, which is downloaded from official minecraft site and comes in a .jar package.

**Java Download issue:**
I was not sure about what Java version to download, as there is JDK and a Java SE.Some tutorial said to download one while other said to download the other.In the end, I downloaded JDK, as I read that it also comes with what Java SE offers.

Next comes the part of downloading JDK. There are bunch of options availabe online. There are many open vendors of JDK. Had too research thoroughly to download the one which will work. I downloaded the Amazon Coretto 16 JDK which was the latest there. The reason to choose Coretto over the others is because it had a ubuntu support and was easy to install. Additionally, Amazon uses this JDK for it's Java technologies. So, this way this gave no issue.

**How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?**
it gave me opportunity to know more about the Minecraft i learned new things i've never heard about so this was a good chance for me to learn more and upgrade myself.
