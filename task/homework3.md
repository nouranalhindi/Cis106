## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her.
