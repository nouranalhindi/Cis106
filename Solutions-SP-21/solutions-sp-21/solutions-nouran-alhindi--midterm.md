## Question 1
> Upgrading the systems will eventually going to help in the longer run. Installing Ubuntu is not going to help much, as 2GB ram and 50GB HDD are not sufficient for todayâ€™s needs. Even simply browsing takes quite a lot of RAM whether one is using Chrome or Firefox. The latest Ubuntu is not lighter on the system than windows 7, comparisons can be seen on YouTube or other websites. On the HDD side, a fresh windows 7 takes 10-12 GB while Ubuntu takes approx 4 GB, so Ubuntu wins here. But, we need to see that 50GB will eventually go to get filled up really quickly.

ON the CPU side, the i3 4th generation is enough for the tasks listed. So, only the RAM and HDD need to be upgraded. Installing a low-capacity SSD like 128 GB for OS will make a significant impact, and for storage, a 320GB+ HDD is enough. RAM, on the other hand, should be a minimum of 6GB or 8GB be fine and able to take advantage of 64bit OS.

So, as discussed in the above two paragraphs, in the longer run, upgrading the system will help. On the other hand, installing Ubuntu is not going to help boost performance. In conclusion, upgrade the system with more RAM and HDD (SSD will be a plus for boot drive).
